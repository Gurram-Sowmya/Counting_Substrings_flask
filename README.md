**Basic Python Flask App for Counting Substrings**
This is a basic Python Flask application that demonstrates how to create a simple web app that counts the number of times a substring appears in a string.

The code uses the Flask microframework to create a web application and expose an endpoint at / that accepts two parameters as input: a string (b) and a substring (a). The application then returns the number of times the substring appears in the string.
